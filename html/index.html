      <h2>CI/CD Pipeline Proof of Concept</h2>
  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <p><strong><h4>Overview</h4></strong>
        This website describes the unseen infrastructure and automation that continously takes some lines of code and turns it into a working product. This project had two goals: 
        <ol>
          <li>Get hands-on experience with some really cool enterprise-grade technologies</li>
          <li>Be entirely cost-free</li> 
        </ol>
        These goals challenged me to better understand the services and to seek out creative solutions. To find out more about me check out <a href="https://resume.sukoneck.com" target="_blank">resume.sukoneck.com</a>.
      </p> 
  <!-- PIPELINE -->
      <p><strong><h4>Pipeline</h4></strong>        
        <h5>Workflow</h5>
          Whenever the source is modified the pipeline will automatically build, publish, and deploy a containerized website:  
          <ol>
            <li>The master branch of the code repository is modified</li>
            <li>The modification triggers the pipeline</li> 
            <li>The pipeline clones the code repository and builds a container image from it</li>
            <li>The pipeline pushes the container image to the image repository with the <code>latest</code> tag</li> 
            <li>The pipeline tells the container hosting service to restart the application</li>
            <li>The hosting service pulls a fresh copy of the <code>latest</code> image from the image repository</li>
            <li>The hosting service serves the <code>latest</code> container</li>
            <li>The DNS and edge cache provider redirects users when they navigate to <a href="https://pipeline.sukoneck.com" target="_blank">pipeline.sukoneck.com</a></li> 
          </ol>
        <h5>Revisions</h5>
          After the pipeline was up and running I optimized for some interesting things: 
          <ul>
            <li>While doing website development I noticed that when I pushed commits to non-master branches the pipeline was still being triggered, but it is an easy change to filter triggers to a specific branch.</li>
            <li>The first iteration of the pipeline used a Docker Hub feature called Automated Builds to build the container image and push it to the image repository. The Automated Build was similarly triggered from by modification to the code repository. The feature is free and convenient; however, the build took two to three minutes. Now, when the pipeline tool executes the build task, it only takes 20 seconds.</li> 
            <li>Normally, new code would be pushed to the host service but as I was watching logs from the hosting service, while troubleshooting an issue with cold starts, I noticed that a new container was pulled from the image repository during the start-up process. So rather than have the pipeline spend time pulling and pushing new code, I simply had it tell the hosting service to restart.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
  <!-- INFRA -->
      <p><strong><h4>Infrastructure Components</h4></strong>
        <h5>Website</h5>
          <p>This website is being served from a docker container running Nginx. There are templates listed in the references section below. I modified the Dockerfile and removed the wrapper.sh content from the template based on what I learned <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18861300/how-to-run-nginx-within-a-docker-container-without-halting" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <h5>Repositories</h5>
          <p>The repository for the code to build this website image is <a href="https://github.com/sukoneck/staticsite" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The repository for this container image is <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sukoneck/staticsite" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a>.</p>
        <h5>Hosting Service</h5>
          <p>The container is hosted in Azure App Service. One of the constraints of the free tier of Azure App Service is that you are unable to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common#configure-general-settings" target="_blank">Always On</a> feature. If the app goes unused for ~5 minutes, then it is turned off and has to go through a cold start when it is used again. The Always On feature keeps the application running by sending http requests to it every 5 minutes or so. For me, the cold start took about 30 seconds, which wasn't actually cool at all. So, I followed Ben Chartrand's <a href="https://liftcodeplay.com/2017/12/19/strategies-for-improving-eliminating-azure-functions-cold-starts/" target="_blank">recommendation</a> and set up an Application Insights availability test, which was also <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/monitor/" target="_blank">free</a>. The traffic from the availability test is enough to keep the app running and prevent that painful cold start. </p>
          <p>One feature that is included in the free App Service is the ability to force HTTPS. This is common practice, but the ability to "<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl#enforce-https" target="_blank">flip a switch</a>" to have HTTP traffic redirected is convenient. </p>
          <p>I love hearing about how people choose between AWS, Azure, and GCP, so for those like me, I'll explain why I chose Azure. I knew I wanted to serve the website from a container and Microsoft offers a free tier for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/linux/" target="_blank">App Service</a>. They also offer a free tier for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a>. The free tiers also seemed like they had workable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits" target="_blank">constraints</a>. AWS has an equivalent service called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">Fargate</a>; however, AWS' "free tier" has a different model than Microsoft's that only lasts for a year and that felt like it would be cheating on goal #2. I also know how quickly a year really passes. GCP recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/" target="_blank">Cloud Run</a> which has an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#always-free-usage-limits" target="_blank">always free tier</a> similar to Microsoft's; however, Cloud Run is still in BETA and I would still need to use Azure DevOps. So, to keep costs actually at zero and to take advantage of that sweet ecosystem <strong>synergy</strong>, I chose Azure. That said, it's on my backlog to move over to Cloud Run later on.</p>
        <h5>Pipeline</h5>       
          <p>There were really only two contenders for pipeline tool, Jenkins and Azure DevOps. I went with Azure DevOps because it's PaaS and also comes with Azure Boards, whereas Jenkins would require managing a host server and adding something like Jira or Trello.</p>
        <h5>DNS</h5>  
          <p>This project was a great opportunity to experiment with Cloudflare, which seems like an <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-fifth-anniversary/" target="_blank">awesome</a> company. I started by migrating the nameservers for <code>sukoneck.com</code> from Namecheap to Cloudflare. This was done with a heavy heart, because I'm a huge Namecheap fan. Fortunately, I've got plenty of goofy domains with Namecheap to play with. With DNS now hosted in Cloudflare, I created a CNAME record, but quickly realized that wasn't going to work. I had forgotten that you have to add a custom domain to your Azure App Service to be able to use a CNAME record. You can see the custom domain error that I saw at <a href="https://CNAMEexample.sukoneck.com" target="_blank">cnameexample.sukoneck.com</a>.</p> 
          <p>The bad news: the custom domain feature of Azure App Service <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain#prepare-the-app" target="_blank">is not free</a>. So, I am stuck with the <code>azurewebsites.net</code> domain to keep everything free. Ok, fine, keep moving. With Namecheap I had set up a ton of URL redirect records for convenience sake, it was as <strong>simple and free</strong> as creating any other DNS record, so I decided that would be a enough of a minimally viable solution for now. Cloudflare approaches URL redirects much differently. I followed Dom J H's <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/using-page-rules-to-perform-redirects/55386" target="_blank">guidance</a> by creating a dummy A record to trigger Cloudflare's DNS and then created a Page Rule to do the permanent redirection from <a href="https://pipeline.sukoneck.com" target="_blank">pipeline.sukoneck.com</a> to the <code>azurewebsites.net</code> URL. Page Rules offer powerful features like path-based routing, but as a result, you only get three free Page Rules. On the brightside, I was still able to take advantage of Cloudflare's <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168326-Are-301-and-302-redirects-cached-by-Cloudflare-" target="_blank">cache</a> service which was caching 72% of content even during site development.</p>

  <!-- BACKLOG -->
      <p><strong><h4>Backlog</h4></strong>
        I accomplished what I had set out to do with this project, but there's always room for <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>. This is what my Azure Boards backlog looks like:
        <ol>
          <li>Solve custom domain issue and more fully utilize Cloudflare features</li>
          <li>Move container hosting to GCP Cloud Run</li>
          <li>Include automated tests that use different deployment slots</li>
          <li>Develop new site features that require multiple container services (e.g. Docker Compose)</li>
          <li>Incorporate a database in the pipeline</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
