      <h3>CI/CD Pipeline Proof of Concept</h3>
      <p><strong><h5>Overview</h5></strong>
        This website describes the unseen infrastructure and automation that continously takes some lines of code and turns it into a working product. This project had two goals:
        <ol>
          <li>Get hands-on experience with some really cool enterprise-grade technologies</li>
          <li>Be entirely cost-free</li> 
        </ol>
        The combination of these goals challenged me to better understand the services and to seek out creative solutions.    
        </p> 
      <p><strong><h5>Infrastructure Components</h5></strong>
        <i>Content in-progress</i>
        This (mostly) HTML website is being served from a docker container running Nginx. The container is hosted 
        
        I'm always curious how organizations decide between AWS, Azure, and GCP, so in good spirit, this is why I chose Azure:
        I knew I wanted to serve the webside from a container and Microsoft offers a free tier for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/linux/" target="_blank">App Service</a>. They also offer a free tier for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a>. The free tiers also seemed like they had workable <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits" target="_blank">constraints</a>. AWS has an equivalent service called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank">Fargate</a>; however, AWS' "free tier" has a different model than Microsoft's that only lasts for a year and that felt like it would be cheating on goal #2. I also know how quickly a year really passes. GCP recently announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/" target="_blank">Cloud Run</a> which has a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#always-free-usage-limits" target="_blank">always free tier</a> similar to Microsoft's; however, if I went with Cloud Run, then I'd need to source my pipeline tool serperately. So, to keep costs actually at zero and to take advantage of the same-provider <strong>synergy</strong> I chose Azure.  
        
        
        The container is hosted in an Azure App Service.
